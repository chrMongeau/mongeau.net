Hi. My full name is *Christian Alexander Mongeau Ospina*. The first part
("Christian Alexander") is composed by two given names and the last part
("**Mongeau Ospina**") by two surnames. This is (or was) the custom in
Spanish-speaking countries: a given name (in my case composite) followed by two
surnames (father's and mother's, respectively).

This is a personal website where I maintain a [**blog**](blog) about
economics, veganism, technology, and random stuff. The main language is
english,[^english] but sometimes I translate the articles or write directly
in other languages: [French](../fr/blog), [Italian](../it/blog) or
[Spanish](../es/blog).

I'm also in:

* [Twitter][]
* [Github][]
* [Google Scholar][]
* [ideas.repec.org][]

My *curriculum vitae* can be found at [mongeau.info][].
